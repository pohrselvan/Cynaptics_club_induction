## Task-1

### Sub Task-1: AI vs. Real Image Classification

I have created a custom model for this classification which can take input size image of 236 X 236 X 3. In this model I have used L1 and L2 regularisation for preventing the overfitting of the model while training

### Sub Task-2: Custom GAN model

I have done dcgan which is trainied on the MNIST dataset to produce the handwritten digit from random noise.
