## Task-1

### Sub Task-1: AI vs. Real Image Classification

I have developed a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) for binary classification tasks, designed to process input images of size 236×236×3. To enhance the model's generalization and prevent overfitting during training, I have incorporated L1 and L2 regularization techniques. L1 regularization promotes sparsity in the weights, while L2 regularization penalizes large weight values, ensuring a more robust and effective model for the classification task.
And here is the score of the model

Hardware: GPU P100
Used Early stopping to prevent overfitting and to get best weight of the model

### Sub Task-2: Custom GAN model

I have implemented a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) that is trained on the MNIST dataset to generate realistic handwritten digits from random noise. The DCGAN consists of two primary components: a generator and a discriminator, which are trained in a competitive setup.

The generator is responsible for transforming random noise vectors into images that resemble handwritten digits. It is designed using a series of transposed convolutional layers (also known as deconvolutional layers) to upsample the input noise into a 28×28×1 grayscale image, matching the MNIST image dimensions. Activation functions like ReLU and Tanh are used to ensure non-linearity and proper output scaling.

The discriminator acts as a binary classifier, distinguishing between real images from the MNIST dataset and fake images generated by the generator. It is constructed with convolutional layers and uses Leaky ReLU activation functions for better gradient flow during training. 

The training involves a minimax game:

The generator aims to produce images that are increasingly realistic, fooling the discriminator.
The discriminator works to accurately identify fake images from real ones.
