## Task-1

### Sub Task-1: AI vs. Real Image Classification

I have developed a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) for binary classification tasks, designed to process input images of size 236×236×3. To enhance the model's generalization and prevent overfitting during training, I have incorporated L1 and L2 regularization techniques. L1 regularization promotes sparsity in the weights, while L2 regularization penalizes large weight values, ensuring a more robust and effective model for the classification task.
And here is the score of the model

### Sub Task-2: Custom GAN model

I have done dcgan which is trainied on the MNIST dataset to produce the handwritten digit from random noise.
